# COSC 465 Lab Self-Assessments
Before self-assessing your code for the first lab, you will need to clone this repository to your home directory on the tigers server.

For subsequent labs, you need to change your working directory in the terminal to your local clone of the assessment repository (`cd ~/assessment`) and run the `git pull` command to obtain the testing scripts for the most recent lab.

After obtaining the testing scripts, change your working directory in the terminal to the appropriate lab directory within the `assessment` folder (e.g., `cd lab01`) and run `./assess.sh`. The self-assessment scripts will operate on the files in the corresponding lab directory in your home directory: e.g., `~/lab01`. An assessment report (`report.txt`) will be created in the directory from which you ran the `assess.sh` script.
